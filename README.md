# Federal Space
Take over space!

## How to play
You spawn in a universe full of static planets. Every planet has its own size. There are 50 planets in a universe and you can go between universes with a click.

Every planet has a chance (2%) to have intelligent life on it. They are harder to colonize because you have to fight the life. But, don't leave them, because they can evolve into a federation that can attack your planets! Declare war as soon as possible.
